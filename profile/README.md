# actions-oss

This is the home of utilities to emulate parts of GitHub Actions based on Open-Source Code written by the Community and Open Source Code provided by GitHub.

You might know us from nektos/act, christopherhx/runner.server and christopherhx/github-act-runner. Over the time more and more of them will migrate to this new home.

See our Documentation Project as well [actions-oss.github.io](https://actions-oss.github.io)
